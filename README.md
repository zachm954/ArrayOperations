# ArrayOperations

This Java project allows users to generate two random arrays of integers and perform several operations on them, such as finding the minimum and maximum values, calculating medians, doubling elements, and identifying differing elements between the arrays.

---

## 📌 Features

- Prompts the user to input the array size
- Randomly generates two arrays with values from 1 to 10
- Finds the **lowest** and **greatest** values in each array
- Calculates the **median** of each array
- Creates a new array with **doubled** values
- Identifies the **indexes** where the two arrays differ
